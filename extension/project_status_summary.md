# Project Status Summary: AdBrain Feed Manager Extension (2025-04-01)

## Project Goal

Refactor and enhance the AdBrain Feed Manager Chrome Extension, focusing on:
1.  Implementing robust Google Account authentication using `chrome.identity`.
2.  Integrating real Google Merchant Center (GMC) Content API calls for feed validation, replacing previous client-side/mock logic.
3.  Refactoring the main UI script (`src/popup/popup.js`) for better maintainability and separation of concerns.

## Current State & Work Completed

*   **Phase 1: Authentication Refactoring (Code Complete)**
    *   `lib/gmc/api.js` was refactored to handle OAuth 2.0 flow via `chrome.identity.getAuthToken`.
    *   Token and Merchant ID storage switched from `localStorage` to `chrome.storage.local`.
    *   `src/popup/login.js` updated to use `GMCApi.authenticate()`.
    *   `src/background/background.js` simplified, removing redundant auth logic.
    *   `src/background/auth.js` identified as redundant.
    *   **Test Mode Added:** Due to user account limitations (see below), a `testMode` flag (defaulting to `true`) was added back to `lib/gmc/api.js` to simulate successful authentication and return a mock Merchant ID (`TEST-ACCOUNT-123`). Logout functionality also handles test mode.

*   **Phase 2: Real GMC Validation (API Logic Complete, UI Integration Incomplete/Broken)**
    *   `lib/gmc/api.js`'s `validateFeed` method updated to use the `products.insert?dryRun=true` endpoint logic (iterating per product).
    *   `lib/gmc/validator.js` refactored to call `gmcApi.validateFeed`, removing local validation rules.
    *   **Test Mode Added:** `GMCApi.validateFeed` returns mock validation issues when `testMode` is true.
    *   `src/popup/popup.js`'s `triggerGMCValidation` (renamed from `validateWithGMC`) was intended to be updated to call the validator and delegate display, but the file state became inconsistent.

*   **Phase 3: Refactor `popup.js` (Started, Incomplete & File State Unreliable)**
    *   **Goal:** Break down the large `popup.js` into smaller manager classes.
    *   **Created Files:**
        *   `src/popup/status_bar_manager.js`
        *   `src/popup/search_manager.js`
        *   `src/popup/feed_manager.js`
        *   `src/popup/validation_ui_manager.js`
    *   **Integration Status:** Attempts to modify `popup.js` to remove the old methods and integrate these new managers using `apply_diff` and `write_to_file` failed repeatedly due to tool errors, likely caused by file size, shifting line numbers, and inconsistent state after partial/failed diff applications.
    *   **`popup.js` State:** The current state of `src/popup/popup.js` is **unknown and potentially corrupted or partially refactored**. It likely contains syntax errors and/or duplicated logic. It **cannot be reliably modified** further using the current tools without manual verification/correction first.
    *   `popup.html` was updated to include script tags for the new managers.

## Key Findings & Learnings

*   The initial project assessment provided (`.features/Updated-Features-assessments.md`) was significantly outdated compared to the actual codebase found in `src/` and `lib/`.
*   The codebase relies on globally defined classes (`window.ClassName = class ...`) loaded via script tags in HTML.
*   Authentication logic was previously fragmented and inconsistent (using `localStorage`, background messages, direct `chrome.identity` calls). This was addressed in Phase 1.
*   "GMC Validation" was previously a mix of extensive client-side checks (`FeedAnalyzer`, local rules in `GMCValidator`) and non-functional API placeholders. Phase 2 added the real API call logic.
*   The primary UI script, `popup.js`, is very large and complex, making automated modifications fragile and error-prone with current tools. Manual editing or more robust refactoring tools are likely required.
*   The user account (`digitalbradley@gmail.com`) used for testing does not have an associated Google Merchant Center account, preventing real API calls from succeeding (specifically the `/accounts/authinfo` call). This necessitated the implementation of the Test Mode to allow UI flow testing.

## Blockers

1.  **`popup.js` Instability:** Cannot reliably modify `popup.js` to complete the refactoring.
2.  **GMC Account:** Cannot test the *real* GMC API integration (Phase 2) without a Google account linked to an active GMC account. Test Mode allows UI testing only.

## Next Steps (Recommended for New Task)

1.  **Fix/Stabilize `popup.js`:** Manually verify the current state, fix syntax errors, and complete the integration of the created manager classes (`StatusBarManager`, `SearchManager`, `FeedManager`, `ValidationUIManager`) by removing the corresponding old logic from `PopupManager`.
2.  **Test Thoroughly (using Test Mode):** Verify all UI interactions work correctly with the refactored code and mock API responses (Login, Status Bar, Feed Preview, Search, Validation Panel display, History update, Logout).
3.  **(Optional/Future):** Implement real API testing once a valid GMC account is available for the test user.
4.  **(Optional/Future):** Continue refactoring `popup.js` (e.g., extracting Tabs, ScrollSync, Export).
5.  **(Optional/Future):** Address TODOs and placeholders noted during refactoring.
