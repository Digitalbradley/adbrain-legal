Okay, I've reviewed the code you provided in popup.js, popup.css, and popup.html. I haven't seen the specific content script file from @content, but I can assess the popup portion thoroughly.

Here's my assessment of the codebase and its current state:

# Overall Assessment:
- Functionality: The extension provides a solid foundation for a feed management tool. It can load CSV files, display them in a preview table, perform basic client-side analysis (title/description length, duplicates, image format), and has UI elements for exporting, GMC connection verification, and validation (though some are marked as PRO or placeholders). 
- It includes features like search, basic filtering, tabs for different views (Preview, History), and interactive elements like editable fields and draggable panels.
- Structure: The JavaScript (popup.js) is organized into a main PopupManager class that orchestrates various helper classes/managers (TableManager, LoadingManager, ErrorManager, GMCApi, GMCValidator, FeedAnalyzer). This modular approach is good practice.
- UI/UX: The HTML (popup.html) defines a clear structure with distinct sections (branding, controls, data area, footer). The CSS (popup.css) provides reasonably modern styling, including sticky headers/controls, custom scrollbars, styled tables, modals, tabs, and interactive elements. The UI seems functional and aligns with the provided screenshot.
- Code Quality (JavaScript):
Uses classes and modern JavaScript features (async/await, const/let).
Event handling seems reasonably well-organized.
Includes helper functions for common tasks (debounce, sanitizeText).
Error handling is present (ErrorManager, try/catch blocks).
There's a basic monitoring system mentioned (MonitoringSystem), although its implementation isn't fully visible.
Code Quality (CSS):
Uses descriptive class names.
Includes styling for various states (hover, focus, active).
Has styles for different components (buttons, tables, modals, panels, tabs, search).
Includes basic responsiveness (@media queries for the footer).
Some areas might benefit from further organization (e.g., grouping related component styles).
Completeness vs. @instructions: The current codebase implements some aspects mentioned in the @instructions (like basic validation rules, UI structure, error display concepts) but lacks the core GMC API integration, detailed error handling framework, status management, and advanced UI enhancements outlined in those documents. The existing GMCValidator and GMCApi seem like placeholders or are focused on client-side analysis rather than actual API interaction.
Current State Breakdown:
File Handling: Loads and parses CSV files.
Feed Preview: Displays data in a sortable, searchable, filterable table. Includes editable fields for title/description with basic character counts and visual feedback. Pagination UI is present but likely not fully functional yet.
Basic Analysis: Performs client-side checks on the loaded data (e.g., title/description length, duplicates) via FeedAnalyzer.
GMC Integration: Buttons exist (Verify GMC Connection, Validate Feed), but the underlying GMCApi and GMCValidator likely don't perform real API calls yet. The "Validate Feed" button currently triggers the local FeedAnalyzer and displays results in a panel.
Validation History: A tab and table structure exist, implying storage and retrieval of past validation results (likely using chrome.storage), but the display logic might need refinement based on actual GMC validation data.
UI: Features tabs, styled buttons, a search bar with basic options, advanced filter placeholders, draggable results panels, and loading/error indicators.
PRO Features: Some functionality (Validate Feed button, specific analysis checks mentioned in comments/code) is marked or gated as "PRO".
Plan for Enhancement (Based on @instructions):
The existing codebase provides a good starting point. We can now integrate the features planned in the @instructions documents, following their suggested order:
Module 1: GMC Integration (01_gmc_integration/)
Implement GMCApiClient: Flesh out the GMCApi class (or rename/refactor to GMCApiClient as per instructions) to handle OAuth 2.0 authentication (chrome.identity) and make actual calls to the Google Content API for Shopping (e.g., products.list, potentially products.insert if needed later). Start with authentication (01_gmc_api_setup.md).
Implement FeedValidator: Refactor the existing GMCValidator (or create FeedValidator as per instructions) to use the GMCApiClient. Implement methods to fetch product statuses and validate items against actual GMC rules, not just the basic client-side checks (02_feed_validator.md).
Integrate Validation: Update the "Validate Feed" button's event handler (handleValidateClick or similar) to use the new FeedValidator, display progress, and handle API responses (03_validation_integration.md).
Status Management: Implement the StatusManager class to display GMC connection status and Merchant ID, likely fetching this info via the GMCApiClient (04_status_manager.md).
Module 2: Error Handling (02_error_handling/)
Implement ErrorHandler: Refine or replace the existing ErrorManager with the more robust ErrorHandler specified in the instructions, capable of categorizing, logging, and displaying different types of errors (API errors, validation errors, UI errors) (01_error_handler_setup.md).
Implement ErrorDisplay: Create the UI component to show errors clearly to the user, potentially integrating with the ErrorHandler (02_error_display.md).
Integrate Error Handling: Ensure all major operations (API calls, file parsing, validation) use the ErrorHandler (03_integration.md).
Module 3: UI Enhancements (03_ui_enhancements/)
Implement LoadingStateManager: Formalize the loading state management (replace or enhance LoadingManager) as described, providing visual feedback during long operations like API calls or large file processing (01_loading_state.md).
Implement UIManager (Optional but Recommended): Consider creating a dedicated UIManager to centralize DOM manipulation and UI updates, making PopupManager less cluttered (02_ui_manager.md).
Refine UI Components: Improve existing components (table, modals, panels) and add new ones (like detailed validation results display) based on the instructions and potentially using a more structured approach (03_component_refinement.md).
Responsiveness & Animations: Add CSS for better responsiveness and subtle animations as suggested (04_responsiveness_animations.md).
What I Need to Proceed:
Confirmation of Starting Point: Do you agree with starting on Module 1: GMC Integration, specifically implementing the OAuth flow and basic API client structure in GMCApi (or GMCApiClient) as outlined in instructions/01_gmc_integration/01_gmc_api_setup.md?
File Structure: Confirm the locations for the core logic files (e.g., src/lib/gmc/api.js, src/lib/validation/validator.js, etc.) are correct as used in popup.html.
Content Script: Could you clarify the purpose and filename of the script mentioned in @content? Is it needed for the initial GMC integration steps?
Once we clarify the starting point, I can help you write the necessary code modifications for GMCApi.js and potentially popup.js to handle the authentication flow.
