# Direct Validation Rollout Plan

This document outlines the strategy for gradually rolling out the new modular implementation of the direct validation functionality. The goal is to ensure a smooth transition from the old implementation to the new implementation, with minimal risk and the ability to roll back if issues arise.

## Rollout Phases

The rollout will be divided into several phases, each with a specific goal and criteria for moving to the next phase.

### Phase 1: Internal Testing (Week 1)

**Goal:** Verify that the new implementation works correctly in a controlled environment.

**Actions:**
1. Deploy the new implementation with all feature flags disabled
2. Enable feature flags for internal testers only (developers and QA)
3. Conduct thorough testing of all functionality
4. Fix any issues found during testing

**Success Criteria:**
- All functionality works correctly with feature flags enabled
- No critical issues are found
- Performance is comparable to or better than the original implementation

### Phase 2: Limited Production Rollout (Week 2)

**Goal:** Verify that the new implementation works correctly for a small percentage of users in production.

**Actions:**
1. Enable feature flags for 5% of users
2. Monitor for errors and performance issues
3. Collect feedback from users
4. Fix any issues found during the limited rollout

**Success Criteria:**
- Error rate is comparable to or lower than the original implementation
- Performance is comparable to or better than the original implementation
- No critical issues are reported by users

### Phase 3: Expanded Rollout (Week 3)

**Goal:** Verify that the new implementation works correctly for a larger percentage of users in production.

**Actions:**
1. Increase feature flag percentage to 25%
2. Continue monitoring for errors and performance issues
3. Continue collecting feedback from users
4. Fix any issues found during the expanded rollout

**Success Criteria:**
- Error rate remains comparable to or lower than the original implementation
- Performance remains comparable to or better than the original implementation
- No critical issues are reported by users

### Phase 4: Full Rollout (Week 4)

**Goal:** Complete the transition to the new implementation for all users.

**Actions:**
1. Increase feature flag percentage to 100%
2. Continue monitoring for errors and performance issues
3. Continue collecting feedback from users
4. Fix any issues found during the full rollout

**Success Criteria:**
- Error rate remains comparable to or lower than the original implementation
- Performance remains comparable to or better than the original implementation
- No critical issues are reported by users

### Phase 5: Cleanup (Week 5)

**Goal:** Remove the feature flag system and the original implementation.

**Actions:**
1. Remove feature flag checks from the new implementation
2. Remove the original implementation
3. Update HTML to only load the new modules
4. Deploy the changes

**Success Criteria:**
- Application works correctly without feature flags
- No critical issues are reported by users

## Feature Flag Configuration

The feature flags are configured in the `feature-flags.js` file. The following flags are available:

- `USE_NEW_CORE`: Controls the core orchestration and entry point
- `USE_NEW_DATA`: Controls data retrieval and processing
- `USE_NEW_UI`: Controls UI-related functionality
- `USE_NEW_HISTORY`: Controls validation history management
- `USE_NEW_TABS`: Controls tab switching functionality
- `USE_NEW_LOADING`: Controls loading indicator functionality
- `USE_NEW_ALL`: Master switch that controls all modules

The rollout will be controlled by the `ROLLOUT_CONFIG` object in the `feature-flags.js` file:

```javascript
const ROLLOUT_CONFIG = {
  ENABLED: true,            // Master switch for rollout
  PERCENTAGE: 5,            // Percentage of users to enable features for (0-100)
  ROLLOUT_ID: 'dv-rollout', // ID for storing rollout state
  MODULES: {                // Percentage per module (if using granular rollout)
    CORE: 10,               // Start with a slightly higher percentage for core
    DATA: 10,               // Start with a slightly higher percentage for data
    UI: 5,                  // Start with the base percentage for UI
    HISTORY: 5,             // Start with the base percentage for history
    TABS: 20,               // Start with a higher percentage for tabs (low risk)
    LOADING: 20             // Start with a higher percentage for loading (low risk)
  }
};
```

## Monitoring and Error Tracking

Monitoring and error tracking are essential for a successful rollout. The following metrics will be tracked:

### Error Metrics

- **JavaScript Errors:** Track JavaScript errors in the browser console
- **API Errors:** Track errors in API calls
- **UI Errors:** Track errors in UI interactions

### Performance Metrics

- **Load Time:** Track the time it takes to load the application
- **Validation Time:** Track the time it takes to validate a feed
- **UI Responsiveness:** Track the responsiveness of the UI during validation

### User Feedback

- **Support Tickets:** Track support tickets related to validation functionality
- **User Surveys:** Conduct surveys to gather feedback from users
- **Direct Feedback:** Collect direct feedback from users through the application

## Error Response Plan

In case of issues during the rollout, the following steps will be taken:

1. **Identify the Issue:**
   - Analyze error logs and monitoring data
   - Reproduce the issue in a development environment
   - Determine the root cause

2. **Assess the Impact:**
   - Determine the severity of the issue
   - Determine the number of users affected
   - Determine the impact on business operations

3. **Decide on a Course of Action:**
   - If the issue is critical, roll back to the original implementation
   - If the issue is non-critical, fix it in the new implementation and deploy the fix

4. **Communicate:**
   - Inform stakeholders of the issue and the course of action
   - Provide regular updates on the progress of the fix
   - Inform users of any changes that may affect them

5. **Implement the Solution:**
   - Deploy the fix or roll back to the original implementation
   - Verify that the issue is resolved
   - Update the rollout plan if necessary

## Rollback Procedure

In case of critical issues that cannot be quickly resolved, the following rollback procedure will be followed:

1. **Disable Feature Flags:**
   - Set all feature flags to `false` in `feature-flags.js`
   - Set the rollout percentage to 0%

2. **Verify Original Implementation:**
   - Verify that the original implementation works correctly

3. **Communicate:**
   - Inform stakeholders of the rollback
   - Provide information on the issues that led to the rollback
   - Provide a timeline for addressing the issues

4. **Address Issues:**
   - Fix the issues in the new implementation
   - Conduct thorough testing to verify that the issues are resolved
   - Update the rollout plan with a new timeline

## Criteria for Increasing Rollout Percentage

The decision to increase the rollout percentage will be based on the following criteria:

1. **Error Rate:**
   - The error rate must be comparable to or lower than the original implementation
   - No critical errors should be reported

2. **Performance:**
   - Performance must be comparable to or better than the original implementation
   - No significant performance degradation should be observed

3. **User Feedback:**
   - No significant negative feedback should be received from users
   - Any issues reported by users should be addressed before increasing the percentage

4. **Monitoring Period:**
   - Each rollout phase should be monitored for at least one week before increasing the percentage
   - If issues are found, the monitoring period should be extended until the issues are resolved

## Conclusion

This rollout plan provides a structured approach to transitioning from the old implementation to the new modular implementation of the direct validation functionality. By following this plan, we can ensure a smooth transition with minimal risk and the ability to roll back if issues arise.

The success of the rollout will be measured by the following criteria:

1. **Functionality:** All functionality works correctly with the new implementation
2. **Performance:** Performance is comparable to or better than the original implementation
3. **User Experience:** Users do not experience any disruption during the transition
4. **Maintainability:** The new implementation is easier to maintain and extend
